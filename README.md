## Student Score Prediction
A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts student final exam scores based on various academic and lifestyle factors. This project explores different regression models to identify the best approach for student performance prediction.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data and builds predictive models to forecast final exam scores. The implementation includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple machine learning approaches including linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest regression.

## Objectives
Predict student final exam scores based on multiple features
Compare performance of different regression models
Identify key factors influencing student academic performance
Provide insights for educational institutions and students

## Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive student performance dataset containing:

**Features:**
**Student_ID**: Unique identifier for each student

**Gender:** Student's gender (Male/Female)
Study_Hours_per_Week: Weekly study hours
Attendance_Rate: Class attendance percentage
Past_Exam_Scores: Previous academic performance
Parental_Education_Level: Education background of parents
Internet_Access_at_Home: Availability of internet access
Extracurricular_Activities: Participation in extracurriculars

**Target Variable:**
Final_Exam_Score: The score to be predicted (0-100)

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy - Numerical computations
Matplotlib - Data visualization
Seaborn - Statistical data visualization
Scikit-learn - Machine learning models and evaluation

## Machine Learning Models
The project implements and compares three regression approaches:
Linear Regression - Baseline model
Polynomial Regression - Captures non-linear relationships
Random Forest Regressor - Ensemble method for complex patterns
